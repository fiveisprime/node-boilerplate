Node App Boilerplate
===

Get a Node.js app up and running quickly.

### Server

Uses Express (listens on port `3000` unless specified) and Handlebars templates.

### Client

Uses Bower for package management. Bower is configured to save dependencies to `public/js/lib` to make the addition of client side
dependencies simpler.
