Node App Boilerplate
===

Get a Node.js app up and running quickly.

# Server

Uses Express (listens on port `3000` unless specified) and Handlebars templates.

# Client

Uses Make to build the dependencies. Run `make build` prior to starting the
server to ensure that the public assets are available.

Run `make lint` to lint the files using JSHint (also triggered on build).
